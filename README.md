# Svelte Examples

Here is a list *(i maybe will keep up to date)* with some niche svelte(kit) features where the documentation/information is limited and hard to properly research without prior knowledge in those niches. \
All the examples here are as stripped down as possible so its easy to copy-paste everything into any codebase without any huge roadblocks. \
In every folder you find a info.txt which describes in short what you need to do, here you find a description of what xy does

## 01 - SSE
SSE - Server Sent Event - is a way to send data from the server to the client. It is not featured out of the box which makes it hard to find direkt examples with sveltekit.

# 02 - Protected Route
A protected route is a route where you need a password to access it, this is a simple and save enough method to do exactly this because the server *should* never send the page without the password in the first place.
