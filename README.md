# Svelte Examples

Here is a list *(i maybe will keep up to date)* with some niche svelte(kit) features where the documentation/information is limited and hard to properly research without prior knowledge in those niches. \
All the examples here are as stripped down as possible so its easy to copy-paste everything into any codebase without any huge roadblocks. \
In every folder you will find a readme which will describe what you need to do as simple as I can possible describe it, here is just a quick explanation about what something can do/is used for

## [01 - SSE](https://github.com/flloschy/SvelteExamples/tree/main/01-SSE)
SSE - Server Sent Event - is a way to send data from the server to the client. It is not featured out of the box which makes it hard to find direkt examples with sveltekit.

## [02 - Protected Route](https://github.com/flloschy/SvelteExamples/tree/main/02-ProtectedRoutes)
A protected route is a route where you need a password to access it, this is a simple and save enough method to do exactly this because the server *should* never send the page without the password in the first place.

## [03 - File Upload](https://github.com/flloschy/SvelteExamples/tree/main/03-FileUpload)
A way to upload files to the server

## [04 - Session](https://github.com/flloschy/SvelteExamples/tree/main/04-Sessions)
A *(bad, cruel and)* basic example of Sessions and User Authentifikation to give an idea on how to do it your self! [reasons why to do it your self](https://github.com/flloschy/SvelteExamples/tree/main/04-Sessions/README.md#4-info)
